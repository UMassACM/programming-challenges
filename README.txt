UMass ACM solutions to programming challenges of all sorts, algorithm
implementations, and whatever our members see fit to include.

Programming competitions are about algorithmic know-how, strategy, and having
a good time. UMass Amherst CS competes in the ACM ICPC every year!

The programming challenges fall into these categories:
- ACM ICPC-style programming challenges, from the UVA online judge collection.
  These are the most appropriate for programming team practice.
- Project Euler problems, which tend toward the mathematical.
- Miscellaneous challenges and contests

Contributing:
- Commit only your *source* files, that is the .java, .c, .cpp, .py, etc. files
  that contain your code. Do not include binaries, platform-specific, or other
  secondary files. The .gitignore settings should help you with this.
- Write commit headers that include the problem ID and language, are phrased as
  an imperative ("add solution" instead of "added solution") and are shorter
  than 80 chars in length.
- There are no strict naming conventions on solutions. Please use current
  solutions as models for your own: that is, make your UVA solution like the
  others, your euler contribution like the others, etc. Maintain the directory
  structure as it is now.
- There is no need to include your name or dates in your source code files.
  Your authorship and contributions are recorded by git. Run `git log` to
  see all contributions; to learn more about a specific solution, run
  `git log path/to/solution` to see the history of the file in question.
- Please thoroughly comment your solutions, especially noting any insights
  to the problem structure or method, since the whole point of this is to
  teach each other and improve as a group.

Disclaimer:

Please note that programming competition coding has almost no
relation to software development or scientific programming, and the solutions
presented here are not indicative of anyone's true programming style and
development practices.
