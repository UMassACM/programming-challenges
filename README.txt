UMass ACM solutions to the ACM ICPC-style programming challenges
collection of the UVA online judge.

Programming competitions are about algorithmic know-how, strategy, and having
a good time. UMass Amherst CS competes in the ACM ICPC every year!

Please note that programming competition coding has almost no relation to
software development or scientific programming, and the solutions presented here
are not indicative of anyone's true programming style and development practices.
