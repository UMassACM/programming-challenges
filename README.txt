UMass ACM solutions to programming challenges of all sorts, algorithm
implementations, and whatever our members see fit to include.

Programming competitions are about algorithmic know-how, strategy, and having
a good time. UMass Amherst CS competes in the ACM ICPC every year!

The programming challenges fall into these categories:
- ACM ICPC-style programming challenges, from the UVA online judge collection.
  These are the most appropriate for programming team practice.
- Project Euler problems, which tend toward the mathematical.
- Miscellaneous challenges and contests

Disclaimer: please note that programming competition coding has almost no
relation to software development or scientific programming, and the solutions
presented here are not indicative of anyone's true programming style and
development practices.
