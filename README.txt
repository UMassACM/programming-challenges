UMass ACM solutions to programming challenges of all sorts, algorithm
implementations, and whatever our members see fit to include.

Programming competitions are about algorithmic know-how, strategy, and having
a good time. UMass Amherst CS competes in the ACM ICPC every year!

The programming challenges fall into these categories:
- ACM ICPC-style programming challenges, from the UVA online judge collection.
  These are the most appropriate for programming team practice.
- Project Euler problems, which tend toward the mathematical.
- Miscellaneous challenges and contests

Please note that programming competition coding has almost no
relation to software development or scientific programming, and the solutions
